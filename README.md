INTRODUCTION
------------
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for time series prediction of a stock market company. 
Implemented standard averaging as well as exponential moving average to find the predicted and actual stock market prices of a certain stock company. 
Used long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which are artificial recurrent neural networks that have feedback connections as well as can process entire sequences of data and are used for deep learning. 
I used the Twitter stock dataset that contains the data distribution of the high and lows, as well as the opening and closing stock market prices of a certain company on the stock market.

INSTALLATION
------------
The file named, "RNN", contains the .py file which I used for this project that runs with the TWTR.txt data downloaded from Yahoo Finance.
